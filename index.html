          I am a juggler. I first took up this art form in high school and I
          continue to grow my skills today. Juggling is many things and takes
          many forms, like poi and club passing. It goes by many names, such as
          spinning or circus arts. It is exciting and challenging. It is
          something you can do alone or with a group.

          It was also around this time that I was introduced to the

            >Philadelphia Jugglers Club</a
          >, which still exists today.
